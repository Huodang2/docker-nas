# GUI (Optional)

A friend of mine actually wanted a interface as he is not very good at linux. You can follow this [guide](https://linuxconfig.org/install-gui-on-ubuntu-server-18-04-bionic-beaver) to setup a small gui to use. I recommend Mate. I will not walk through installing this for my own server as I did not install it for myself. I preffer to keep the base OS as clean as possible.
